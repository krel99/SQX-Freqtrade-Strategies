Not all strategies are hopeful at all. A lot of this is rubbish collected from the internet which I am testing. The rest was meant to be forex strategies from StrategyQuantX rewritten here. But most of it is AI generated ideas quickly tested in my pipeline.

Many of the ideas don't turn profits or don't do so reliably. MultiIndicatorMomentum, AlternativeMultiIndicatorMomentum and FractalStrategy are among first strategies that can be optimized to satisfactory results --- in tests. May or may not be profitable with real money.

If you get errors, install freqtrade directly, not through Docker.
