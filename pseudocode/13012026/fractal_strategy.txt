Strategy: Fractal Corridor Breakout

This strategy identifies trading opportunities by detecting breakouts from corridors formed by price fractals. It uses a long-period moving average as a trend filter to ensure entries are aligned with the dominant market direction.

Parameters:
- Fractal Window: The number of candles used to identify a fractal (e.g., 3 or 5).
- Breakout Threshold: A percentage value added to/subtracted from the fractal corridor to confirm a breakout.
- MA Length: The lookback period for the long-period moving average.
- Take Profit Multiplier: A factor used to determine the take-profit level based on the corridor width (e.g., 4x).

Indicators:
1. Long-Period Moving Average (e.g., EMA): Establishes the overall trend.
2. Fractal Tops (Resistance): Identified when a candle's high is greater than the highs of its neighboring candles.
3. Fractal Bottoms (Support): Identified when a candle's low is lower than the lows of its neighboring candles.

Entry Logic (Long):
1. Trend Confirmation: The current price is trading above the long-period moving average.
2. Breakout Signal: The price closes above the last fractal top, plus the breakout threshold.
   - `close > (Last Fractal Top * (1 + Breakout Threshold))`

Exit Logic (Long):
1. Take Profit: The price reaches the entry price plus the corridor width multiplied by the take-profit factor.
   - `Take Profit = Entry Price + ((Last Fractal Top - Last Fractal Bottom) * Take Profit Multiplier)`
2. Stop-Loss: The price closes below the last fractal bottom.

Entry Logic (Short):
1. Trend Confirmation: The current price is trading below the long-period moving average.
2. Breakout Signal: The price closes below the last fractal bottom, minus the breakout threshold.
   - `close < (Last Fractal Bottom * (1 - Breakout Threshold))`

Exit Logic (Short):
1. Take Profit: The price reaches the entry price minus the corridor width multiplied by the take-profit factor.
   - `Take Profit = Entry Price - ((Last Fractal Top - Last Fractal Bottom) * Take Profit Multiplier)`
2. Stop-Loss: The price closes above the last fractal top.

Execution:
- The strategy continuously monitors price action, updating fractal levels as new ones form.
- When entry conditions are met, a trade is opened in the direction of the trend.
- The trade is closed when either the take-profit or stop-loss level is reached.
