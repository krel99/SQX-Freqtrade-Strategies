7. Momentum Ignition with RSI Confirmation (1m / 5m)
   Concept: Buy strong momentum bursts in direction of recent move, confirming that the move is not overextended (RSI not too high for long, not too low for short).

Indicators:

Rate of Change (ROC) or simple price change over N candles

RSI(14)

timeframe = "1m"

populate_indicators(dataframe):
dataframe.roc = (close / close.shift(5) - 1) \* 100 # 5-candle ROC
dataframe.rsi = RSI(close, 14)
return dataframe

    buy_signal = (
        (roc > 1.0)                                          # >1% move in last 5 candles
        AND (rsi between 50 and 70)                          # strong but not extremely overbought
        AND (close > close.shift(1))                         # last candle green
    )

        AND (rsi between 30 and 50)
        AND (close < close.shift(1))                         # last candle red
